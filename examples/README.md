## Logo spinner

A spinner I made of my personal logo for my [portfolio](https://ewen.works).

_Note: the abrupt ending is not an NÃ®mes bug, it's just me stopping the recording mid-animation_


Files:

- **logo-spinner.js** the file that ran the animation generation
- **logo-spinner.css** the result of running `node logo-spinner.js > logo-spinner.css`
